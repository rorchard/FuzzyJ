<a href="#Operations_on_FuzzySets">A Comment on the Range of Membership Values</a>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>A <b>fuzzy set </b>is a mapping of a set of real numbers (x<sub>i</sub>)
onto <i>membership values</i> (u<sub>i</sub>) that (generally) lie in the range
[0, 1]. In this fuzzy package a fuzzy set is represented by a set of pairs u<sub>i</sub>/x<sub>i</sub>,
where u<sub>i</sub> is the membership value for the real number x<sub>i</sub>.
We can represent the set of values as { u<sub>1</sub>/x<sub>1</sub> u<sub>2</sub>/x<sub>2</sub>
... u<sub>n</sub>/x<sub>n</sub> }. The x values in the set are in increasing
order (x<sub>1</sub> &lt;= x<sub>2</sub> &lt;= ... &lt;= x<sub>n</sub>). Values
prior to x<sub>1</sub> have the same membership value as x<sub>1</sub> and
values after x<sub>n</sub> have the same membership value as x<sub>n</sub>.
Values between x<sub>i</sub> and x<sub>i+1</sub> are determined by the value
that lies on the straight line between the 2 consecutive points. In effect we
are representing a graph with straight lines joining the points in the fuzzy
set and with horizontal lines extending to the first and from the last points. </p>

<p>Just as a side note, it is common for the (x,y) pairs of a fuzzy set to be
represented as y/x in the fuzzy logic world. This can be a bit confusing at
first because the x,y order is reversed, but it might help to think of the <b>u/x</b>
meaning the <b>membership value u at x</b>.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the (convex) fuzzy set { 0.0/0.3 1.0/0.5 0.0/0.7 }.
As shown in the diagram below, this is a triangular shaped fuzzy set. This is a
very compact representation of a fuzzy set that covers all values in the real
number line.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><img border=0 width=300 height=200
id="_x0000_i1025" src=basicFuzzyValue.gif></p>

<p>The code to create this FuzzySet would simply be:</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><tt><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FuzzySet fSet = new
triangleFuzzySet( 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 );</span></tt> </p>

<p>&nbsp;Consider now a slightly more complex (non-convex)
FuzzySet:&nbsp;&nbsp; { 0.0/0.1<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>1.0/0.3<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>0.65/0.4<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>1.0/0.5<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>0.0/0.8 } </p>

<p>&nbsp;.<img border=0 width=302 height=200 id="_x0000_i1026" src=normal.gif> </p>

<p>The code to create this 5 point fuzzy set might look something like: </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New";mso-fareast-font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
double yValues[] = {0, 1, 0.65, 1, 0};</span> <br>
<tt><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
double xValues[] = {0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8};</span></tt> <br>
<tt><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FuzzySet fSet = new FuzzySet( xValues, yValues, 5 );</span></tt> </p>

<p>A fuzzy set defined by a single point, for example { 0.5/25 }, represents a
single horizontal line (a fuzzy set with membership values of 0.5 for all x
values). Note that this is <b>not </b>a single point! </p>

<p>To represent such <b><i>singletons</i></b> one might use { 0.0/0.5 1.0/0.5
0.0/0.5 }. This is in effect a graph that has membership values of zero for all
x values except at the x value 0.5 where it is 1. This sort of fuzzy set is
sometimes used to <b><i>fuzzify</i></b> crisp values (when there is no error in
the x value). Often a crisp value, such as a temperature reading, is valid only
within some tolerance so other fuzzy set shapes are used to fuzzify the value,
such as a PIFuzzySet or a TriangleFuzzySet. As of version 1.3 of FuzzyJ, there
is a SingletonFuzzySet class that allows for easy creation of singleton
FuzzySets:</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><tt><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FuzzySet fSet = new
SingletonFuzzySet( 0.5 );</span></tt> </p>

<p>Note that, when possible, the points stored will be optimized in various
ways to reduce the number required. For example, if three points in a row have
the same y (membership) value then the middle point will be dropped or if the
first two or last two points have the same y value then the first or last point
will be dropped. </p>

<h4><a name="Fuzzy_Set_Hierarchy"></a><a name="_Fuzzy_Set_Hierarchy"></a>Fuzzy
Set Hierarchy</h4>

<p>To simplify the creation of FuzzySets a hierarchy of subclasses has been
defined. The FuzzySets that can be built by this set of subclasses represents a
fairly complete set of common shapes. The user is able to sub-class and
generate further types to meet specific needs. The hierarchy is shown below. </p>

<p><img border=0 width=522 height=402 id="_x0000_i1027" src=FShierarchy.gif></p>

<p>Each of these is explained in more detail in the <a href="APIdocs/index.html">API
documentation</a>. However, let's consider the TriangleFuzzySet briefly. It is
a sub-class of (specialization of) a TrapezoidFuzzySet since it is basically a
trapezoid shape where the left and right sides of the trapezoid meet at the
same point. The TrapezoidFuzzySet is a sub-class of the LRFuzzySet which
defines shapes that have a left (L) part, a right (R) part and a middle part
(with all values set to 1). The left part slopes from a y-value (membership
value) of 0 to 1 and can have various shapes. The right part slopes from a
y-value of 1 to 0, and again can have various shapes. The TrapezoidFuzzySet is
just an LRFuzzySet with both the left and right parts being linear. The
LRFuzzySet and the TrapezoidFuzzySet are shown below. </p>

<p><img border=0 width=344 height=240 id="_x0000_i1028" src=LRFuzzySet2.gif><img
border=0 width=344 height=240 id="_x0000_i1029" src=TrapezoidFS2.gif><br>
To repeat, the TrapezoidFuzzyset is an LRFuzzySet with the left and right sides
defined to be linear rather than arbitrary shapes. The TriangleFuzzySet is a
TrapezoidFuzzySet with points 2 and 3 at the same location. In terms of
simplicity of generation the TrapezoidFuzzySet can be defined with 4
x-coordinates and the TriangleFuzzySet only needs 3 x-coordinates, whereas the
LRFuzzyset requires that the 4 x-coordinates plus two functions that determine
the shape of the left and right sides. The simple RectangleFuzzySet only needs
2 x-coordinates to be defined. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h4><a name="Where_are_FuzzySets_Used"></a><a name="_Where_are_Fuzzy"></a>Where
are Fuzzy Sets Used</h4>

<p>Although one can create Fuzzy Sets and perform various operations on them,
in general they are mainly used when creating Fuzzy Values and to define the
linguistic terms of Fuzzy Variables.&nbsp; This is described in the section on <a
href="FuzzyVariable.html#Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Values and Fuzzy">Fuzzy Variables</a>.
At some point it may be an interesting exercise to add FuzzyNumbers to the
toolkit. These would be specializations of FuzzySets with a set of operations
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division defined on them. </p>

<h4><a name="_Some_of_the"></a>Some of the Operations on FuzzySets</h4>

<p>The API documentation describes a large number of operations and
manipulations that can be applied to FuzzySets. Most often there is a
corresponding capability for FuzzyValues with the restriction that the UOD
(universe of discourse, or range of x values) must be observed for the
FuzzyValues and for binary operations, such as intersection and union, the two
FuzzyValues <u>must</u> have the same FuzzyVariable. The most commonly used
operations will be (see the <a href="APIdocs/index.html">API documentation</a>
for the complete set of operations): </p>

<p><b>fuzzyComplement</b> <br>
Takes the compliment of the FuzzySet. More specifically, it takes the
compliment of the membership (y) values of the SetPoints of the FuzzySet.
Mathematically (NOT), u<sub>compl</sub>(x) = 1 - u(x), or y<sub>compl</sub> = 1
- y. </p>

<p><b>fuzzy Intersection</b> <br>
Returns the intersection of two FuzzySets. The visual representation of the
intersection of two example FuzzySets is depicted below. One set is black with
green SetPoints, and the other set is grey with orange SetPoints. The diagram
on the left is of the two FuzzySets, and the diagram on the right is of the two
sets showing the intersection set in red (plain red SetPoints and red lines
joining them). Intersection is synonymous with the logical operator AND. The
intersection of two fuzzy sets is (often and specifically in FuzzyJ) defined
such that the membership (y) value at any x value is the minimum of the
membership values of the two fuzzy sets.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=320 height=228 id="_x0000_i1030" src=twoSets.gif><img
border=0 width=329 height=228 id="_x0000_i1031" src=twoSetsIntersection.gif></p>

<p><b>fuzzyUnion</b> <br>
Returns the union of two FuzzySets. The visual representation of the union of
two example FuzzySets is depicted below. One set is black with green SetPoints,
and the other set is grey with orange SetPoints. The diagram on the left is of
the two FuzzySets, and the diagram on the right is of the two sets showing the
union set in red (plain red SetPoints and red lines joining them). Union is
synonymous with the logical operator OR. The union of two fuzzy sets is (often
and specifically in FuzzyJ) defined such that the membership (y) value at any x
value is the maximum of the membership values of the two fuzzy sets.</p>

<p><img border=0 width=320 height=234 id="_x0000_i1032" src=twoSets.gif><img
border=0 width=323 height=240 id="_x0000_i1033" src=twoSetsUnion.gif></p>

<p><b>maximumOfIntersection</b> <br>
Returns the maximum membership value of the intersection set formed by two
FuzzySets. Consider the two diagrams below. On the right appears a diagram of
two sets, one set in black with green SetPoints, and the other set in grey with
orange SetPoints. The maximum y value of the intersection is denoted by a red
dot on the graph on the right. </p>

<p><img border=0 width=320 height=227 id="_x0000_i1034" src=twoSets.gif><img
border=0 width=323 height=227 id="_x0000_i1035" src=twoSetsMaxMin.gif></p>

<p><b>Some Defuzzification Operations on FuzzySets<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Below are some methods that convert a FuzzySet back into a single crisp (non-fuzzy)
value. This is something that is normally done after a fuzzy decision has been
made and the fuzzy result must be used in the real world. For example, if the
final fuzzy decision were to adjust the temperature setting on the thermostat a
‘little higher’, then it would be necessary to convert this ‘little higher’
fuzzy value to the ‘best’ crisp value to actually move the thermostat setting
by some real amount.</p>

<p><b>maximumDefuzzify</b> <br>
Finds the mean of the maximum values of a fuzzy set as the defuzzification
value. NOTE: This doesn't always work well because there can be x ranges where
the y value is constant at the max value and other places where the maximum
value is only reached for a single x value. When this happens the single value
gets too much of a say in the defuzzified value. </p>

<p><img border=0 width=433 height=145 id="_x0000_i1036" src=meanOfMaxProb.gif></p>

<p><b>momentDefuzzify</b> <br>
Moment defuzzification defuzzifies a fuzzy set returning a floating point
(double value) that represents the fuzzy set. It calculates the first moment of
area of a fuzzy set about the y axis. The set is subdivided into different
shapes by partitioning vertically at each point in the set, resulting in
rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids. The centre of gravity (moment) and area
of&nbsp;each subdivision is calculated using the appropriate formulas for each
shape. The first moment of area of the whole set is then: <br>
<img border=0 width=457 height=121 id="_x0000_i1037" src=momentEquation.gif><br>
where x<sub>i</sub>' is the local centre of gravity, A<sub>i</sub> is the local
area of the shape underneath line segment (p<sub>i-1</sub>, p<sub>i</sub>), and
n is the total number of points. As an example, <br>
<img border=0 width=408 height=288 id="_x0000_i1038" src=momentGraph.gif><br>
For each shaded subsection in the diagram above, the area and centre of gravity
is calculated according to the shape identified (i.e., triangle, rectangle or
trapezoid). The centre of gravity of the whole set is then determined: </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>x' = (2.333*1.0 + 3.917*1.6 + 5.5*0.6 +
6.333*0.3)/(1.0+1.6+0.6+0.3) = 3.943…</p>

<p><b>centerOfAreaDefuzzify (new in version 1.8)<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Center of Area (COA) defuzzification finds the x value such that half of the
area under the fuzzy set is on each side of the x value. In the case above (in
the momentDefuzzify section) the total area under the fuzzy set is 3.5
(1.0+1.6+0.6+0.3). So we would want to find the x value where the area to the
left and the right both had values of 1.75. This occurs where x <span
style='color:black'>= </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:black;
background:silver;mso-highlight:silver'>3.816699867329622</span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>. Note that in general the result
of momentDefuzzify and centerOfAreaDefuzzify are not the same. Also note that
in some cases the center of area can be satisfied by more than one value. For
example, for the fuzzy set defined by the points:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:black'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">    </span>(5,0) (6,1) (7,0) (15,0) (16,1) (17,0)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>the COA could be any
value from 7.0 to 15.0 since the 2 identical triangles centered at x=6 and x=16
lie on either side of 7.0 and 15.0. We will return a value of 11.0 in this case
(in general we try to find the middle of the possible x values). </span></p>

<p><b>weightedAverageDefuzzify (new in version 1.3)<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>Finds the weighted average of the x values of the points that define a fuzzy
set using the membership values of the points as the weights. This value is
returned as the defuzzification value.&nbsp; For example, if we have the
following fuzzy set definition:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=468 height=324 id="_x0000_i1039"
src=FuzzySet1ForWeightedAvg.jpg></p>

<p>Then the weighted average value of the fuzzy set points will be:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>(1.0*0.9 + 4.0*1.0) / (0.9 + 1.0) = 2.579</p>

<p>This is only moderately useful since the value at 1.0 has too much influence
on the defuzzified result. The moment defuzzification is probably most useful
in this case. However, a place where this defuzzification method is very useful
is when the fuzzy set is in fact a series of singleton values. It might be that
a set of rules is of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type (1<sup>st</sup> order) with
formats like:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>If x is A and y is B then c = k</p>

<p>where x and y are fuzzy variables and k is a constant that is represented by
a singleton fuzzy set. For example we might have rules that look like:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>If temperature is low and pressure is low then set
hot valve to medium_high position</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>If temperature is high and pressure is high then
set hot valve to medium_low position</p>

<p style='margin-left:4.0in'><b>. . .<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>where the setting of the hot valve has several possibilities, say
full_closed, low, medium_low, medium_high, high and full_open, and these are
singleton values rather than normal fuzzy sets. In this case medium_low might
be 2 on a scale from 0 to 5. </p>

<p>An aggregated conclusion for setting the hot valve position (after all of
the rules have contributed to the decision) might look like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img border=0 width=468 height=324 id="_x0000_i1040"
src=FuzzySet2ForWeightedAvg.jpg></p>

<p>And the weighted average defuzzification value for this output would be:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>(1.0*0.25 + 2.0*1.0 + 3.0*0.5 + 4.0*0.5) / (0.25 +
1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5) = 2.556</p>

<p>Note that neither a maximum defuzzification nor a moment defuzzification
would produce a useful result in this situation. The maximum version would use
only 1 of the points (the maximum one) giving a result of 2.0 (the x value of
that point), while the moment version would not find any area to work with and
would generate an exception. This description of the weightedAverageDefuzzify
method will be clearer after you have completed the sections on <a
href="FuzzyValue.html">FuzzyValues</a> and <a href="FuzzyRule.html">FuzzyRules</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Operations_on_FuzzySets"></a><a name="_A_comment_on"></a>A Comment
on the Range of Membership Values</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Although
the range of allowed membership values is normally [0, 1], it is possible to
form FuzzySets with membership values &gt; 1.0. There are instances where this
is desirable. For example in some approaches it is preferred to collect the
outputs of fuzzy rules by doing a <b>fuzzySum</b> of the resultant FuzzyValues
(global contribution of rules). The fuzzySum operation can result in FuzzySets
with membership values &gt; 1.0. When a FuzzySet/FuzzyValue is created with a
constructor (that uses arrays of Doubles or an array of SetPoints) the values
are restricted to being between 0 and 1. However, when the fuzzySum operation
or the methods appendSetPoint and insertSetPoint are used to add points to the
FuzzySet, membership values &gt; 1 are allowed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>This
does have some implications of which the user needs to be aware. For example,
the fuzzyComplement operation on a FuzzySet will treat membership values &gt; 1
as if they were 1. It may be desirable at certain times to normalize (or scale)
FuzzySets that have membership values &gt; 1. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>Do
note that membership values are always restricted to values &gt;= 0. In most
cases the negative value is simply changed to a value of 0.</p>

<p>A case where a user might want to allow this to happen is when one wants to
use the SAM (Standard Additive Model) method as described in Bart Kosko’s book,
Fuzzy Engineering (<a href="references.html">see reference section</a>). In
this case, the collection of fuzzy outputs from multiple rules (global
contribution) is done by adding (a fuzzySum of) the outputs. The resultant sum
is then defuzzified using the momentDefuzzify method to give the required
result. In order to completely perform the SAM method one would also need to
ensure that the RuleExecutor was set to be a MamdaniMinMaxMinRuleExecutor and
that the operator used to collect the results from multiple antecedents in a
rule was the ProductAntecedentCombineOperator. This is explained in more detail
elsewhere.</p>
